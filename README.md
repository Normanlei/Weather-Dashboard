## Description

As proceeing as a web developer, using another application's API and using it in the context of their own are the most commom tasks that web developer would be assigned. Third-party APIs allow us to access their data and functionality by making requests with specific parameters to a URL. In our daily life, weather dashborad is one of the tools that most of us mush use. In this application, I am going to use the OpenWeather API (https://openweathermap.org/api) to build a weather dashboard with below details:
